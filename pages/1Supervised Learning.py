    text = """**Supervised Learning:**
    \nSupervised learning is a branch of machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled data. 
    This data consists of input features (X) and corresponding outputs or labels (y). The algorithm learns a 
    mapping function from the input features to the outputs, allowing it to predict the labels for 
    unseen data points.
    \n**Classification:**
    Classification is a specific task within supervised learning where the labels belong to discrete 
    categories. The goal is to build a model that can predict the category label of a new data 
    point based on its features.
    \n**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):**
    KNN is a simple yet powerful algorithm for both classification and regression tasks. 
    \n**The Wine Quality Dataset:**
    The Wine Quality dataset includes data on various physicochemical properties of wines and their quality ratings.
    The quality is an integer score, and the dataset includes the following features:
    * Fixed Acidity (typically in g/dm³)
    * Volatile Acidity (typically in g/dm³)
    * Citric Acid (typically in g/dm³)
    * Residual Sugar (typically in g/dm³)
    * Chlorides (typically in g/dm³)
    * Free Sulfur Dioxide (in mg/dm³)
    * Total Sulfur Dioxide (in mg/dm³)
    * Density (typically in g/cm³)
    * pH (on a scale from 0 to 14)
    * Sulphates (typically in g/dm³)
    * Alcohol (percentage by volume)
    \n**KNN Classification with Iris:**
    \n1. **Training:**
    * The KNN algorithm uses the WineQT dataset (features and labels) as its training data.
    \n2. **Prediction:**
    * When presented with a new set of wine characteristics (unknown quality), KNN calculates the distance (often Euclidean distance) 
    between this set's features and all the samples in the training data.
    * The user defines the value of 'k' (number of nearest neighbors). KNN identifies the 'k' closest 
    data points (wines) in the training set to the new sample.
    * KNN predicts the quality rating for the new wine based on the majority vote among its 
    'k' nearest neighbors. For example, if three out of the five nearest neighbors have a quality rating of 8, 
    the new wine is predicted to have a quality rating of 8.
    **Choosing 'k':**
    The value of 'k' significantly impacts KNN performance. A small 'k' value might lead to overfitting, where the 
    model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data. Conversely, a large 'k' value might not 
    capture the local patterns in the data and lead to underfitting. The optimal 'k' value is often determined 
    through experimentation.
    \n**Advantages of KNN:**
    * Simple to understand and implement.
    * No complex model training required.
    * Effective for datasets with well-defined clusters."""
